//pointer is a data type, you can declare a variable of that type
//to declare it needs to be type* pointer_name
//int* p;
//int* p = 0; declare and initialize

//how to make a pointer point to something

//int *p; 
//int y;

//to access the location of a variable, use the address operator '&'
//p = &y; //y is of type int and p is the pointer to an int, make p point to y
//now we say p --> y
//we can now change y through p 
//int *p, y;
//*p = 50; //changing y via p (indirectly change y)
//*p = *p + 1;

//pointer assignment and pointer arithmetic: Trace the code
//how can we use pointers to successfully swap the values of two variables
